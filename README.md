# Golden Ratio
<!-- Plugin description -->
Plugin for the JetBrains Platform, that makes it easier to work while many splits are open by resizing the active editor to be larger.
Golden Ratio is inspired by the [Emacs](https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el) and [Vim](https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio) 
plugins of the same name by [Roman Gonzalez](https://github.com/roman).
<!-- Plugin description end -->

Best way to install is via the [JetBrains Plugin Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19376-goldenratio).

## Usage
Out of the box, GoldenRatio will automatically resize editor panes as the active selection changes.
It also provides 2 actions that can be found in `Window > Editor Tabs` that are used for manually invoking a resize,
or temporally disabling the plugin from resizing on pane selection changes. Both of these can be bound to keys.

Settings are found in `Preferences > Editor > GoldenRatio` and let you change what the target ratio is, 
as well as disabling GoldenRatio from auto invoking when editor pane selection changes.
