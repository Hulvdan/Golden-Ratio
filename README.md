# Golden Ratio
<!-- Plugin description -->
Plugin for the JetBrains Platform, that makes it easier to work while many splits are open by resizing the active editor to be larger.
Golden Ratio is inspired by the [Emacs](https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el) and [Vim](https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio) 
plugins of the same name by [Roman Gonzalez](https://github.com/roman).
